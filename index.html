    <p>
        This function takes two numbers as parameters, the first number being the coefficient, <br>
        and the second number being the exponent.<br>
        <br>
        Your function should multiply the two numbers, and then subtract 1 from the exponent. <br>
        Then, it has to print out an expression (like 28x^7). "^1" should not be truncated when <br>
        exponent = 2.<br>
        <br>
        For example:<br>
        <br>
        derive(7, 8)<br>
        <br>
        In this case, the function should multiply 7 and 8, and then subtract 1 from 8. It <br>
        should output "56x^7", the first number 56 being the product of the two numbers, and the <br>
        second number being the exponent minus 1.<br>
        <br>
        derive(7, 8) --> this should output "56x^7" <br>
        derive(5, 9) --> this should output "45x^8" <br>
        <br>
        Notes:<br>
        <br>
        The output of this function should be a string<br>
        The exponent will never be 1, and neither number will ever be 0<br>
